## What is this
If you've unwittingly stumbled across this repository and are wondering what this is for, it is simply a small application that I've created to sample some cutting edge technologies that have caught my eye. I also plan on using it as a template for future applications.

### Technologies
- Koa
- Vue
- GraphQL
- MongoDB

### Database Added!
This project now makes use of a mongodb database. To connect to a database, add the details to **now-secrets.json**. I've added a script to seed the db which can be run to populate the database that the application needs to run. You can run this script with the command:
```
yarn seed-db
```
